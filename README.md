💁🏻 About Me, 
======================

# 혁신적인 개발자를 꿈꾸는 대학생,

안녕하세요, 현재 미국 대학교, Purdue University 에서 Computer Science를 전공 중인 오준석입니다.
새로운 것을 만들어 내는게 취미인 저는 과제를 할때에도 코드를 재미있고 효율적인 방식으로 가독성 높게 짜는 편입니다.
아직 개발 경험은 턱없이 부족하지만, 끈기있게 배움을 포기하지 않고 더 도움이 되는 개발자가 되겠습니다.

# Dreaming to become an Innovative Developer,

Hello! My name is Junseok Oh.
Usually, I love to create something new throughout my life and don't hesitate to learn about
things that I feel are interesting. And this made my code more creative and efficient at the same time in college,
which also made readers have 'fun' reading and reviewing my code.
I do not have enough development experience, but I will stay busy learning new concepts and becoming a more reliable and innovative developer.

I am currently a Junior at Purdue University Computer Science, specializing in the Machine Intelligence track and minoring in Mathematics. I am currently in an active search for an opportunity for the upcoming summer season internship. I love to create something new throughout my life and don't hesitate to learn about things that I feel are interesting. And this made my code more creative and efficient at the same time in college, which also made readers have 'fun' reading and reviewing my code. I always stay busy learning new concepts and becoming a more reliable and innovative developer.
